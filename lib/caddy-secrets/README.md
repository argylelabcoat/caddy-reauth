# caddy secrets

> This is a direct copy of the code that was originally hosted at [https://github.com/startsmartlabs/caddy-secrets](https://github.com/startsmartlabs/caddy-secrets). To the people who wrote this originally, I can not longer build Caddy server from source because of this dependency which is required by `freman/caddy-reauth/backends/refresh/auth.go`. If you feel that you need more attribution (I cannot see the individual members of `smartsmartlabs`), or protest to have `caddy-secrets` be archived in this way, please contact me.

Special thanks for [Andrew Lee](https://github.com/gilgameshskytrooper) for archiving this for me originally

I've decided to embed this so I can keep it up to date easily without the rather small external dependancy.
